Hello!

I'm an engineer graduated in 2008 with a specialization in telecommunications. Over the years, I have been dedicated to providing technical consulting services to broadcasters and video producers, helping them find innovative solutions for their needs. My passion for creating efficient solutions has led me to develop both hardware and software solutions, combining my technical knowledge and creativity.

I also love planes and rockets üòÅ
